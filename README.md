# Space-Engineers-Script-Collection
This is my personal collection of scripts, my own as well as other I try to learn from.

Car Controller: 
	A basic controller for wheeled vehicles that takes care of brake lights, reverse lights, automatic spotlight activation/deactivation and handbrake pulling when leaving the wheeled vehicle.

Drillstation Controller: 
	Automation Script for a certain drillstation. Unfortunatly SE changed how rotors work and now this makes the station explode. No longer continued because I discovered PAM - Path Auto Miner, which makes a mining station look like a joke.

Housekeeping: 
	Deprecated predecessor of Master Orgy.
	
Lift Controller: 
	Makes an elevator wagon work. Requires the Master Orgy Script to communicate with to open doors and stuff. Can also be used as a straight taxi or even be abused to measure some things.

Master Orgy: 
	Do-it-all script. Takes care of energy, garage doors, production, lights...
